### **Assignment 7: Testing and Deploying Microservices**

1. **Unit Testing Spring Boot Microservices**
   - Write unit tests for the service layer of your banking microservice using `@MockBean` and `@WebMvcTest`. Ensure that methods like transferring funds between accounts are tested.

2. **Integration Testing for Microservices**
   - Write integration tests for your microservices using `@SpringBootTest`. Mock external dependencies (like the database) and test the complete flow of the microservice (e.g., placing an order and generating an invoice).

3. **Testing Kafka Producers and Consumers**
   - Write tests for your Kafka producer and consumer using `EmbeddedKafka` to simulate a Kafka environment and verify that messages are correctly produced and consumed.

4. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline for your microservices using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions. Ensure that code is automatically tested and deployed to a staging environment.

5. **Containerizing Microservices with Docker**
   - Dockerize your microservices and ensure that each service is containerized with its own Dockerfile. Also, implement Docker Compose for managing multi-container setups (e.g., microservices, Kafka, database).

6. **Kubernetes Deployment for Microservices**
   - Write Kubernetes manifests to deploy your microservices to a Kubernetes cluster. Set up services, deployments, and configurations for each microservice and its dependencies (like Kafka and databases).

7. **Monitoring and Logging with ELK Stack**
   - Implement centralized logging for your microservices using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). Set up log aggregation and create a dashboard to monitor system health.
