   - Discuss the limitations of distributed transactions and how compensating actions can be implemented when one step of the saga fails (e.g., rollback actions).

5. **Implementing Idempotency in Kafka Consumers**
   - Implement idempotent processing in a Kafka consumer. Ensure that duplicate messages (due to retries or network issues) do not affect the system state (e.g., duplicate transaction processing in a banking system).
   - Discuss how Kafka guarantees message delivery and how you would handle situations where consumers fail to process a message successfully.

6. **Spring Cloud for Service Discovery and Resilience**
   - Set up a microservices system using Spring Cloud, with Eureka for service discovery and Hystrix for fault tolerance. Ensure that the system can handle failure scenarios like one service being unavailable, and the requests are routed to a fallback service.
