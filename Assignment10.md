### **Assignment 10: Advanced Kafka and Microservices Architecture**

1. **Kafka for Event Sourcing and CQRS**
   - Design and implement a microservices system using Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation). Implement separate services for handling write operations (commands) and read operations (queries), and use Kafka to handle event publishing and consumption.
   - Explain the challenges of maintaining consistency in a system using Event Sourcing and CQRS, and how Kafka can help ensure eventual consistency between services.

2. **Kafka Streams for Real-Time Data Processing**
   - Create a real-time streaming application using Kafka Streams in a Spring Boot application to process large amounts of transactional data. Implement a feature to calculate the moving average of customer transaction amounts over a sliding window.
   - Optimize the Kafka Streams topology for high throughput and low latency. Discuss the trade-offs between stateful and stateless operations in Kafka Streams and their impact on performance.

3. **Kafka Consumer Groups and Partitioning Strategies**
   - Design a system where multiple microservices consume messages from Kafka topics in parallel. Explain how you would design a partitioning strategy to ensure load balancing across consumers while ensuring message ordering.
   - Implement and demonstrate consumer group behavior by having multiple instances of a service processing the same Kafka topic. Discuss how consumer lag can be monitored and handled.

4. **Microservices Transaction Management with Kafka**
   - Implement a distributed transaction system using Kafka and the Saga pattern to manage multi-step transactions. For example, in a banking system, process a money transfer operation involving multiple microservices (e.g., debit account, credit account, and send receipt).
   - Discuss the limitations of distributed transactions and how compensating actions can be implemented when one step of the saga fails (e.g., rollback actions).

5. **Implementing Idempotency in Kafka Consumers**
   - Implement idempotent processing in a Kafka consumer. Ensure that duplicate messages (due to retries or network issues) do not affect the system state (e.g., duplicate transaction processing in a banking system).
   - Discuss how Kafka guarantees message delivery and how you would handle situations where consumers fail to process a message successfully.

6. **Spring Cloud for Service Discovery and Resilience**
   - Set up a microservices system using Spring Cloud, with Eureka for service discovery and Hystrix for fault tolerance. Ensure that the system can handle failure scenarios like one service being unavailable, and the requests are routed to a fallback service.
   - Configure circuit breakers for critical services (e.g., payment processing) and demonstrate how they prevent cascading failures in the system.

7. **API Gateway with Spring Cloud Gateway**
   - Implement a Spring Cloud Gateway to act as an API Gateway for routing requests to multiple microservices. Use filters to handle cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and rate limiting.
   - Implement dynamic routing based on service health or user roles (e.g., route requests for admin users to a special service). Ensure that the gateway can handle load balancing and failover automatically.

8. **Microservices and Security with OAuth2**
   - Implement OAuth2 authorization using Spring Security OAuth2 to secure your microservices. Set up an Authorization Server, Resource Server, and Client for authenticating and authorizing users in a banking system.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained permissions for different types of users (e.g., customer, admin, support staff).
