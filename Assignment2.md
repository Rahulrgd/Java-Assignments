### **Assignment 2: Advanced Java and Spring Boot Topics**

1. **Java Collections and Streams**
   - Implement a program to count the number of occurrences of each word in a given text using Java Streams.
   - Write a program that uses Java Streams to filter out all odd numbers from a list and returns only even numbers.

2. **Spring Boot Service Layer**
   - Create a service layer in your Spring Boot application to handle business logic. Add a method in your service that calculates the total balance of all users from the `User` entity.

3. **Spring Boot with Security**
   - Implement basic authentication in your Spring Boot application using Spring Security. Protect an endpoint so that only authenticated users can access it.

4. **Spring Boot Unit Testing with JUnit**
   - Write unit tests for the CRUD operations in your `User` entity using JUnit and `@SpringBootTest`.

5. **Spring Boot Profiles**
   - Implement multiple profiles in your Spring Boot application (e.g., `dev`, `prod`). Configure different database connections for each profile.

6. **DTO and Mapper Implementation**
   - Implement a `UserDTO` class and use a Mapper to convert between `User` entity and `UserDTO`. Demonstrate this mapping in a controller endpoint.
