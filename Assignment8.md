### **Assignment 8: Final Project (Banking System) with Microservices and Kafka**

1. **Designing the Banking System**
   - Design a high-level architecture for a banking system that includes microservices for user management, transaction processing, fraud detection, and account management. Use Kafka for communication.

2. **Implementation of Services**
   - Implement the microservices based on your design. The services should handle tasks like account creation, balance checking, fund transfer, and transaction history using RESTful APIs.

3. **Kafka for Real-Time Transactions**
   - Use Kafka to process real-time banking transactions. For example, an event is triggered when a transaction occurs, which is consumed by another service to update the account balance.

4. **Security Implementation**
   - Secure your microservices using OAuth2 and JWT tokens for authentication and authorization. Implement role-based access control for sensitive endpoints like fund transfer.

5. **Integration and Testing**
   - Integrate all services and test the complete workflow of the banking system. Ensure transactions are processed correctly, and Kafka is used for event-driven communication.

6. **Deploying the Complete System**
   - Containerize the entire banking system using Docker and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster. Set up Kafka and the database containers, and configure the system for scalability.
